# Encrypt Selected PDFs

This AppleScript will encrypt selected PDFs in Finder using the supplied password (encryption key).

This **WILL NOT** work in Apple Shortcuts.

This is updating the work originally done by **shockwave562** ([reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/j7dzdj/shortcut_to_passwordprotect_pdfs/)) for executing in other environments like Xcode.
